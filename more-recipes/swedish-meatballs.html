    <p>Description: This Swedish meatball recipe is our family's Christmas tradition. 
        We frequently double the recipe and keep it warm in a slow cooker. 
        Worth the effort, and the meatballs are even better the next day! 
        Reserve brown gravy and add sour cream to it the day you serve the leftovers.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices day-old white bread, crumbled</li>
        <li>&half; cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of butter</li>
        <li>1 small onion, minced</li>
        <li>&frac23; pound ground beef</li>
        <li>&frac13; pound finely ground pork</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of brown sugar (optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>&frac14; teaspoon of ground black pepper</li>
        <li>&frac14; teaspoon of ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>&frac14; teaspoon of ground allspice</li>
        <li>&frac18; teaspoon ground ginger (optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of butter</li>
        <li>&frac14; cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth, or as needed</li>
        <li>&frac12; (8 ounce) container sour cream</li> 
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F (350&deg;C).</li>
        <li>Place bread crumbs into a small bowl; mix in cream. Allow to stand until crumbs absorb cream, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, melt 1 teaspoon of butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until light brown, about 10 minutes. 
            Transfer onion into a mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Mix ground beef, ground pork, egg, brown sugar, salt, black pepper, nutmeg, allspice, and ginger with onion in the mixing bowl.
            Lightly mix in bread crumbs and cream.</li>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Pinch off about 1&frac12; tablespoon meat mixture per meatball;
            form into balls. Place meatballs into the skillet and cook, turning often, until browned, about 5 minutes.
            Insides of meatballs will still be pink.</li>
        <li>Place browned meatballs into a baking dish, pour in chicken broth, and cover with foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until meatballs are tender, about 40 minutes. Remove meatballs to a serving dish.</li>
        <li>Pour pan drippings into a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk flour into drippings until smooth.</li>
        <li>Gradually whisk in enough beef broth to total about 2&frac12; cups liquid.</li>
        <li>Brings gravy to a simmer, whisking constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Just before serving, whisk in sour cream. Season with salt and black pepper. Serve gravy with meatballs.</li>
    </ol>
